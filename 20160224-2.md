Advantages of the cloud operating system approach

Security: Isolation is thought of in terms of networks, 
locally everything is single user. 
Which is the case for most web apps anyway (www-user) (mysql user)) - 
Breaking in for Botnet purposes is harder (you own the vm and then what?), reduced attack surface
Elasticity: e.g Erlang on Xen or Docker spin up new applications in milliseconds instead of seconds or minutes for normal VMs
Faster: no or less operating system overhead
Build with configuration distribution in mind: e.g. Core OS has a distributed config system
App deployment is simplified: The whole image can become the unit of deployment. Basically the kernel now is only a small piece attached to the application rather than the other way around
Disadvantages of the cloud operating system approach

Monitoring: You cannot use standard monitoring tools, on the other hand you’d probably don’t need them. Just use in App monitoring and metering
Debugging: Your application has to provide some remote debugging interface, because the layer beneath might not have it (e.g. no ssh)
Security: The attack surface is minimized but that does not mean everything is solved. You still have to secure your app
Current System APIs might not be there: Depending on the approach you might not have POSIX-APIs or higher level Linux-APIs for lower level stuff.
